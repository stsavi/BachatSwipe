### Swipe smart. Save more.

**BachatSwipe** is an intelligent credit card optimization engine for India that tells you the best way to pay for any expense — ensuring you maximize rewards, cashback, and savings on every transaction.

## 🚨 The Problem
India’s credit card ecosystem is fragmented and complex. Rewards vary by:
- **Bank Portals** (SmartBuy, Travel Edge, etc.) vs Direct Swipe
- **Voucher Programs** (GyFTR, Amazon vouchers)
- **Merchant Categories** (Dining, Travel, Shopping)
- **Card Type** (Cashback vs Reward Points vs Miles)

Users often miss out on 5-10% extra value because they don't know the optimal "path" to pay.

## ✅ The Solution
BachatSwipe answers a simple question: **"How should I pay for this expense to get the maximum benefit?"**

It evaluates all valid payment paths:
1.  **Direct Swipe** on merchant website
2.  **Bank Portals** (e.g., buying flights via HDFC SmartBuy)
3.  **Voucher Route** (e.g., buying Amazon Pay vouchers via GyFTR)
4.  **Wallet Loads** (e.g., loading Paytm wallet with a specific card)

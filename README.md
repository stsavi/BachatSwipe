💳 BachatSwipe
Swipe smart. Save more.
A app to tackle the hassle of finding the right credit card for an expense.

BachatSwipe is an intelligent credit card optimization engine for India that tells you the best way to pay for any expense — not just the best card, but the best payment path.

Instead of guessing or browsing multiple websites, BachatSwipe evaluates direct swipe, bank portals, vouchers, and cashback paths to help users maximize rewards, cashback, or savings on every transaction.

🚨 The Problem (Real & Painful)

India’s credit card ecosystem is extremely fragmented and complex:

Each bank has:

Different reward structures

Different portals (SmartBuy, iShop, GrabDeals, SBI Rewards, etc.)

Different voucher programs

Rewards change based on:

Merchant

Category

Portal vs direct swipe

Voucher vs normal payment

Cashback, reward points, discounts, and vouchers all work differently

Users are forced to:

Check multiple blogs

Browse forums

Memorize card rules

Still often miss the best option

❌ Current tools don’t solve this

Most apps:

Recommend a card, not a payment path

Focus on bill payments or deals, not optimization

Don’t compare portal vs voucher vs direct swipe

Don’t explain why a method is best

As a result, users leave money on the table every day.

✅ What BachatSwipe Does Differently

BachatSwipe answers a simple but powerful question:

“How should I pay for this expense to get the maximum benefit?”

It does this by:

Enumerating all valid payment paths

Calculating rewards/cashback per path

Ranking them transparently

Showing every option — not just the top one
